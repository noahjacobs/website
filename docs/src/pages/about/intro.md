# Intro

<p class="description">Thinking is drawing in your head.</p>

What are thoughts made of? The idea of the nest in the bird's mind, where does it come from? As a Computer Scientist and Cognitive Scientist, this is what I'm principally interested in. Ideas on ideas...

I'm fascinated by new emerging technologies, AI algorithms, which can be used for us to offload cognition, offload menial tasks, and free us to living in richer creative and social spaces. The future of humanity is us focusing our minds and inhabiting spaces that are linguistic constructs, spaces built and shaped by mind, and thoughts, and intentionality. I'm a strong advocate for the ethical implementation of machine learning (not all applications of ML are good), and view privacy as a human right.

## Bio

I’m Noah Jacobs, co-founder and chief technology officer at <a href="https://venturedojo.com/" target="_blank">Venture Dojo</a>, an experiential learning environment for aspiring entrepreneurs, innovators and leaders. I’ve spent my career working with extraordinary businesses, both new to market and loved by millions. I’m drawn to the earliest stages of product creation — defining strategy, experience, brand expression, and the systems necessary to evolve and scale.

Today, I work alongside amazing partners to serve a new wave of entrepreneurs. I’m passionate about equality and partnership, and motivated to help the full spectrum of underrepresented founders gain access to funding and support.

I live in Berkeley with my college friends, read a lot of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43200223-noah-jacobs" target="_blank">books</a>, and see every new experience as an opportunity to learn. My favorite projects are those that require me to push beyond my boundaries and acquire new skills and knowledge in order to succeed. When not rocking monochromatic t-shirts, I can be found composing music, flying airplanes, or carving through mountains on a pair of skis.

## Research

My research draws on topics and methods from Machine Learning, Computational Linguistics (Natural Language Processing) and Quantum Information Theory (specifically the use of category theoretical frameworks). My main project presently involves developing software for analyzing and understanding high-dimensional data from financial securities. I am generally interested in theories of - and applications for - computer science, neuroscience, linguistics, psychology, and philosophy.
